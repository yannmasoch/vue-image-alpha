# vue-image-alpha

**`vue-image-alpha`** is a Vue component allowing to use light-weight transparent images on a website.

It is a remastered version of [imgAlpha.js](https://github.com/yannmasoch/imgAlpha.js) I ceated a few years ago. This `Vue` version has a more efficient code and a faster image processing running in the background using Web Workers and buffer images.

Suggestions are more than welcome, not only for feature requests but also for coding style improvements ðŸ˜ƒ


## How it Works
**vue-image-alpha** uses 2 compressed images such as jpeg format to build a light-weight transparent image. No more ugly GIF and no more heavy PNG!!

Simply save your image in 2 regular jpeg files:
1. The color image (on a plain color background)
2. The alpha image (black is transparent and white is opaque)

## Installation
**`vue-image-alpha`** is a `Vue component` that can be installed as dependency in you `Vue CLI` project.

The easiest way to install it is using NPM: 

```sh
npm install --save vue-image-alpha
```


## Usage

#### Component Initialization
All you need to do is to import `vue-alpha-image` in your `Vue` code

```javascript
import ImgAlpha from 'vue-image-alpha'
...

export default {
    name: 'MyApp',
    components: {
        ImgAlpha,
        ...
    },
    ...
},
```

#### Component Use
Use the component in your `html` or `template` code

```html
<img-alpha src="/path/to/myImage.jpg" src-alpha="/path/to/myImage-alpha.jpg" bg-color="#FFFFFF"></img-alpha>
```

or with data binding
```html
<img-alpha :src="require('/path/to/myImage.jpg')" :src-alpha="require('/path/to/myImage-alpha.jpg')" bg-color="#FFFFFF"></img-alpha>
```


## Props

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
------ | ---- | ------- | -----------
src | string | null | Color image URL
src-alpha | string | null | Alpha image URL
bg-color | string | #FFFFFF | The background color of the src image (optional)

#### scr
The `src` defines the color image source.

#### src-alpha
The `src-alpha` defines the alpha image used to make the color image transparent.

If the alpha image is not provided, the image transparency processing will be skipped and the image will be displayed as a regular image.

#### bg-color (optional)
The `bg-color` defines the background color of the color image. 

By default, the `bg-color` is white (`#FFFFFF`) 

This prop is used to provide a better alpha blending accuracy if you use a background color in the color image different than white.
